*Toolkit for URM Programming*

**Authors:**
Jingyu Yan and Grygoriy Zholtkevych

----

The **project aim** is to develop a toolkit for programming **U**nlimited **R**egister **M**achine (URM) intended for studying computability theory.

The **project tasks** are:

1. to develop a software realization of URM using Python language;
2. to develop functions for manipulating with URM-programs
   1. concatenation of URM-programs,
   2. move URM-programs in memory,
   3. parallelization of URM-programs,
   4. to be added later;
4. to develop a universal program;
5. to be added later.
